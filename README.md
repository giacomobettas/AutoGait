# AutoGait
Autoencoder for anomalous gait recognition on video input.

## Project lineup

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the video dataset for training the autoencoder. This involves extracting frames from the video and converting them into suitable input representations, such as image arrays. Use libraries like OpenCV or FFmpeg to extract frames from videos.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the video frames to enhance the performance of the autoencoder. This may include resizing the frames, normalizing pixel values, and applying any other necessary preprocessing steps to improve the quality and consistency of the input data.

3. **Training Data Selection**: Select a subset of the video data that represents normal or non-anomalous behavior. Ensure that the selected frames capture the typical patterns and variations present in the normal video sequences. This data will be used to train the autoencoder to reconstruct normal frames accurately.

4. **Autoencoder Architecture**: Design the architecture of the autoencoder. Typically, the encoder part of the autoencoder consists of convolutional and pooling layers to capture spatial information, while the decoder part consists of upsampling and deconvolutional layers to reconstruct the original frame dimensions.

5. **Training**: Train the autoencoder using the selected normal video frames. The objective is to minimize the reconstruction error between the input frames and their corresponding reconstructions. The reconstruction error can be measured using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or binary cross-entropy loss.

6. **Validation and Threshold Selection**: Use a separate validation dataset, comprising normal and anomalous video frames, to evaluate the performance of the trained autoencoder. Compute the reconstruction error for both normal and anomalous frames. Analyze the distribution of reconstruction errors and set a suitable threshold to distinguish between normal and anomalous frames. Use techniques like Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis or statistical methods to determine the threshold.

7. **Anomaly Detection**: Apply the trained autoencoder to unseen video frames. Calculate the reconstruction error for each frame using the trained autoencoder. If the reconstruction error exceeds the predefined threshold, classify the frame as an anomaly. Otherwise, consider it as a normal frame.

8. **Post-processing and Visualization**: Perform any necessary post-processing steps on the detected anomalies, such as filtering, temporal analysis, or grouping. Visualize the detected anomalies in the video frames or present them as alerts or notifications.

**Note**: the success of autoencoder-based anomaly detection heavily relies on having a good representation of normal behavior during training and selecting an appropriate threshold for anomaly detection. Additionally, depending on the complexity of the video data, explore more advanced techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or 3D convolutional autoencoders to capture temporal dependencies in the video sequences.
